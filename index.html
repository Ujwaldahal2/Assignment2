        <p>Hi! My name is Ujwal Dahal. I am from Mahendranagar,
            Kshireswarnath Municipality which is about
            225 KM southeast of Kathmandu. From my childhood, I see myself very
            curios, hardworking, honest and serious about my career.During my childhood,
            I always forgot the molecule formula of water(H<sub>2</sub>O). I started
            Primary level education from Saraswati English Boarding School. In
            the time of Schooling, I always obeyed my teachers and did my work
            at time. After My Schooling, I joined Kshireshwar Janta Higher Secondary
            School for my Secondary Education.I Completed my Secondary Education in 2013. Then I joined Gangotri Higher Secondary
            English Boarding School for +2 and completed in 2015. After that I joined Ramsworup Ramsagar Multiple Campus
            and graduated Bachelor in Business Studies (BBS) in 2020 with 2<sup>nd</sup> Division.
            Though I am from management background, I am always interested in computer since my childhood.
            So I learned a lot about computer even I have completed Six month course
            in Application Software where I learned about Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel
            and Microsoft PowerPoint as well.I have also learned about HTML, CSS
            and Basic of Java through online portal like YouTube, Udacity and Udemy etc.

        I always remember my first programming code in Java. It is as given below:
        <br> class HelloWorld {
        <!--br tag-->
        <code>public static void main(String[] args) { <br> <!--code tag-->
                System.out.println("Hello, World!");  } <br>
        }</code><br>
    </div>
    <div class="para3">I worked as Computer and English Lower Secondary Teacher in <abbr
            title="Gangotri Higher Secondary English Boarding School"> GHSEBS</abbr> <!-- abbr tag-->
        for 2 years. As a teacher, I have learned
        a lot from the teachers of my school and the students as well because the environment
        of my school was well disciplined, well managed and down toward earth
        for the supportive learning behavior.
